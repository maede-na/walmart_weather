The objective of this project is to analyze how temperature and fuel prices affect weekly sales in a retail store. By utilizing a dataset containing weekly sales data, temperature, and fuel prices, we aim to uncover insights into the relationships between these variables and quantify their impact on sales through regression modeling.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:
- **Store**,**Date**, **Weekly_Sales**,**Holiday_Flag**,**Temperature**,**Fuel_Price**

## Objectives
1. Visualize the relationships between temperature, fuel prices, and weekly sales.
2. Calculate the correlation coefficients to understand the strength of relationships.
3. Build a linear regression model to quantify the impact of temperature and fuel prices on weekly sales.
